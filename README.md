pySudokuSolver
==============

A small graphical application for solving any Sudoku puzzle, almost instantaneously, along with its solution


Run pySudokuSolver
==================
Execute the script "pySudokuSolver1.2/sudoku_solver.py"


Additional Note
================
The folder "pySudokuSolver 1.2" contains the older, working version of pySudokuSolver based on wxPython
The folder "pySudokuSolver 1.x" contains the newer, under development version of pySudokuSolver based on PyQt4

I will delete the pySudokuSolver 1.2 folder when my porting is complete

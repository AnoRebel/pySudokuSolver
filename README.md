Additional Note
----------------
I am trying to port pySudokuSolver v1.2 from wxPython GUI library to PyQt4 GUI library.
I did not use git upto my v1.2, but I am using it now. So, my repositroy is bit of a mess as of now.

As of now, 
The folder "pySudokuSolver 1.2" contains the older, working version of pySudokuSolver based on wxPython
The folder "pySudokuSolver 1.x" contains the newer, under development version of pySudokuSolver based on PyQt4
This is temporary, and I will delete the pySudokuSolver 1.2 folder when my porting is complete.
